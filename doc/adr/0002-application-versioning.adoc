== Context and problem statement [[context]]

////
Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences or in the form of an illustrative story.
You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question and add links to collaboration boards or issue management systems.

The JBang `run` command can execute several different types of entities.

* Local source files
** jbang run HelloWorld.java
* Remote source files
** jbang run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbangdev/jbang-catalog/refs/heads/main/hello.java
* Gists (Github)
** jbang run https://gist.github.com/maxandersen/f43b4c52dfcfc42dcd59a04e49acf6ec
* GAV coordinates (Maven artifacts)
** jbang run org.example:myapp:1.0.0
* Local JAR files
** jbang run ./hello-fatjar.jar
* Aliases defined in a JBang catalogs
** jbang run hello@jbangdev John

Aliases are shortcuts that are imported from catalogs that in turn point to:

. Script files (local or remote)
. Gists (Github)
. GAV coordinates (Maven artifacts)
. Local JAR files
. Aliases defined in JBang catalogs

A JBang Alias can also be called a JBang Application. Just like with normal software applications, users want to be able to use different versions of the same JBang Application.

// This is an optional element. Feel free to remove.
== Decision drivers [[decision-drivers]]

In order for a user to select a specific version of a JBang Application the following commands must support application versioning.

* The `jbang app install <alias@catalog>` command should support application versioning. The version information should be optional, and if not provided, the latest version of the application should be installed. Otherwise, the requested version of the application should be installed.

* The `jbang run <alias@catalog>` command should support application versioning. The version information should be optional, and if not provided, the latest version of the application should be executed. Otherwise, the requested version of the application should be executed.

== Considered options [[considered-options]]

// Leave these options as they are!
// The rendered output will have the section names with links in place.


. Extend the alias syntax to allow users to specify the version of the application they want to install or run. For example, users could specify the version using the syntax `alias:version@catalog`, e.g., `hello:1.0.0@jbangdev`.

. Add a `--version` option to the `jbang app install` and `jbang run` commands, which allows users to specify the version of the application they want to install or run.

== Decision outcome [[decision-outcome]]

Chosen option:: `alias:version@catalog`, because it very specifically associates the version information with the alias name. The other option defines a general version option and it is not always clear what it applies to.

// This is an optional element. Feel free to remove.
=== Consequences

This section outlines the ripple effects—both the wins and the new responsibilities—resulting from this change.

Positive: Reproducible Workflows::
Users can now pin aliases to specific versions (e.g., jbang mytool:1.2.3@catalog), ensuring CI/CD pipelines and scripts don't break when a remote alias is updated.

Positive: Parallel Testing::
Developers can run multiple versions of the same alias side-by-side for regression testing without manual environment switching.

Neutral: Metadata Overhead::
The JBang local catalog will now need to store and manage version manifests or tags, slightly increasing the complexity of the local state.

Negative: Increased Disk Usage::
Supporting multiple versions will naturally lead to more cached JARs and scripts.

=== Confirmation

////
Describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR is confirmed. E.g., by a review or an ArchUnit test.
Although we classify this element as optional, it is included in most ADRs.
////

Automated Integration Tests::

* Verify that jbang alias:version@catalog correctly fetches and executes the specified release.

* Confirm that jbang alias (without a version) continues to default to the latest or main branch as per current behavior.

* Ensure that invalid version strings return a clear, actionable error message rather than a stack trace.

Cache Validation::

Manually inspect the JBang cache directory to confirm that different versions of the same alias are stored in unique, non-conflicting paths.

Offline Mode Test::

Verify that if a specific version is already cached, JBang can execute it in --offline mode without attempting to hit the remote repository.

Performance Benchmark::

Measure the delta in resolution time between a standard alias and a versioned alias to ensure no significant regressions in startup speed.
